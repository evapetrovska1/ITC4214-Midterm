                <p class="mb-0">
                    Founded in 1994 by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen, DreamWorks Animation revolutionized the industry with groundbreaking films like Shrek. 
                    We've produced over 30 feature films, won multiple Academy Awards, and became the first studio to truly challenge Disney's animation dominance 
                    with our unique storytelling style and technological innovation.

                <p class="mb-0">
                    From Shrek's grumpy charm that subverted fairy tale tropes to Po's unlikely hero journey blending martial arts with Chinese philosophy. 
                    Our characters like Hiccup and Toothless from How to Train Your Dragon, the hilarious Madagascar crew, and the colorful Trolls have become 
                    childhood companions for millions worldwide, creating franchises that span films, series, and merchandise.

                <p class="mb-0">
                    We pioneered realistic fur and hair rendering technology, developed proprietary animation software, and consistently push the boundaries of 
                    3D animation. From the stunning water effects in How to Train Your Dragon to the expressive character animations in The Bad Guys, our technical 
                    innovations have raised industry standards while serving our creative vision.

        What is Lorem Ipsum?
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
